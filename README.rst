pHHotoreceptor is a Hodgkin-Huxley simulator of insect photoreceptor bodies.

Scripts to generate the graphs in the article "Shunt peaking in neural membranes"
(DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2016.0719) are located in the folder scripts/shunt_peaking.

Scripts to generate the graphs in the article "Voltage-dependent K+ Channels 
Improve the Energy Efficiency of Signalling in Blowfly Photoreceptors" 
(https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2016.0938) are located in the folder 
scripts/calliphora_energy.

Scripts to generate the graphs in the article "Modulation of voltage-dependent K+ 
conductances in photoreceptors trades off investment in contrast gain for bandwidths" 
(https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006566) are located in the folder 
scripts/drosophila_shifts.

This program is free software (as in freedom, see license.txt). In addition, 
the authors chose to make it freely available (as in free beer). If you find 
this package useful or you adapt some of it for your own academic work, we 
would appreciate citations to some of the 3 articles mentioned above.
